# Challenge Mode Implementation

## Overview

The Challenge Mode feature adds a new game mechanic that allows users to select predefined challenges with specific goals and restrictions. This enhances the gaming experience by providing structured objectives and varying difficulty levels.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Configuration Structure (`src/configs/games.json`)

Added a `challenges` array with the following challenge modes:

- **No Challenge**: Standard quiz with no special restrictions
- **Perfect Score**: Get all questions right - no mistakes allowed!
- **Speed Challenge**: Complete 15 questions in 3 minutes with countdown
- **Endurance Test**: Complete 20 questions with maximum 3 incorrect answers
- **Lightning Round**: Answer 8 questions correctly in just 2 minutes!

Each challenge has:
```json
{
  "name": "Challenge Name",
  "description": "Challenge description for users",
  "settings": {
    "timerEnabled": boolean,
    "questionsEnabled": boolean,
    "minCorrectAnswers": number,
    "maxCorrectAnswers": number,
    "correctAnswersEnabled": boolean,
    "minIncorrectAnswers": number,
    "maxIncorrectAnswers": number,
    "incorrectAnswersEnabled": boolean,
    "overallTimerEnabled": boolean,
    "overallTimerDuration": number,
    "countdownModeEnabled": boolean,
    "numberOfQuestions": number,
    "timerPerQuestion": number
  }
}
```

### 2. Challenge Mode Utilities (`src/utils/challengeModes.ts`)

Created comprehensive utility functions:

- `getChallengeModes()`: Get all available challenge modes
- `getChallengeMode(name)`: Get specific challenge by name
- `applyChallengeMode(settings, challengeName)`: Apply challenge settings to quiz
- `isChallengeCompleted(...)`: Check if challenge was successfully completed
- `getChallengeCompletionMessage(challengeName)`: Get congratulatory message

### 3. Quiz Store Updates (`src/store/quiz-store.ts`)

Added `challengeMode?: string` field to `QuizSettings` interface to track the selected challenge mode. This is persisted with user preferences.

### 4. Landing Page Integration (`src/app/page.tsx`)

#### Added Challenge Mode Dropdown
- Positioned between Year Level selection and Quiz Settings
- Dropdown with all available challenges
- Shows challenge description when selected
- Automatically applies challenge settings when selected

#### Challenge Mode Logic
- `handleChallengeModeChange()`: Handles challenge selection
- Applies challenge settings via `applyChallengeMode()`
- Preserves user preferences while overriding challenge-specific settings
- Shows Quiz Settings panel when challenge is applied

#### State Management
- `selectedChallengeMode`: Tracks current selection
- `availableChallengeModes`: Loads challenges from config
- Challenge mode is saved to localStorage with other preferences

### 5. Results Page Integration (`src/app/results/page.tsx`)

#### Challenge Mode Display
- Shows selected challenge mode in header with purple badge
- Displays challenge completion status with appropriate messaging

#### Challenge Completion Logic
- Uses `isChallengeCompleted()` to check if challenge was met
- Shows congratulatory message for completed challenges
- Shows encouragement message for attempted but not completed challenges

#### Challenge Completion Messages
- Custom messages for each challenge type
- Visual indicators (emojis and colors) for completion status

### 6. Features Implemented

#### Landing Page Features
✅ Challenge Mode dropdown with label "Challenge Mode"
✅ Default value shows "Select a challenge (optional)" 
✅ Options loaded from JSON configuration
✅ Shows challenge name and description below dropdown
✅ Challenge settings override game mechanics when selected
✅ localStorage integration preserves challenge selection

#### Game Result Page Features
✅ Shows challenge mode in header with distinctive styling
✅ Displays challenge completion status
✅ Congratulatory messages for completed challenges
✅ Encouragement messages for attempted challenges
✅ Challenge mode included in quiz settings summary

#### Technical Features
✅ JSON configuration for easy future modifications
✅ Future-proof design for database integration
✅ Flexible configuration supports any future challenge types
✅ TypeScript interfaces for type safety
✅ Integration with existing game mechanics
✅ Persistent storage of challenge preferences

## Usage Flow

1. **Selection**: User selects a challenge from the dropdown on landing page
2. **Configuration**: Challenge settings automatically apply to game mechanics
3. **Visual Feedback**: Challenge description shows below dropdown
4. **Settings Override**: Challenge settings take precedence over year level presets
5. **Game Play**: Quiz runs with challenge-specific constraints
6. **Results**: Results page shows challenge status and completion message
7. **Persistence**: Challenge preference is saved for next session

## Future Enhancements

The implementation is designed for easy extension:

- **Database Integration**: Replace JSON config with API calls
- **Dynamic Challenges**: Add time-based or user-progress-based challenges
- **Achievement System**: Link challenges to achievement unlocking
- **Leaderboards**: Track challenge completion times and scores
- **Custom Challenges**: Allow users to create their own challenges

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test each challenge mode for proper rule enforcement
2. Verify challenge completion detection accuracy
3. Test localStorage persistence of challenge selections
4. Verify UI updates when challenges are selected/deselected
5. Test challenge interaction with year level presets
6. Validate challenge settings override behavior

## Files Modified

- `src/configs/games.json` - Challenge configurations
- `src/utils/challengeModes.ts` - Challenge utilities (new file)
- `src/store/quiz-store.ts` - Added challengeMode field
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Challenge selection UI and logic
- `src/app/results/page.tsx` - Challenge completion display

This implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria and provides a robust, extensible foundation for the Challenge Mode feature.
